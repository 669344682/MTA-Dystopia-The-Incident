Uses dxDrawImage for map/blips, instead of the default F11 map.
This gives you a little bit more functionality; i.e. custom HUD map, custom blips, any size/scale/rotation, coloring.
Reads normal blips as well, so it will work instantly.

-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR BASIC USE
--

Toggle Map: "F11"
Hold (Quick-View): "/"
Command: "/map"

You can change this in client.lua very easily, or just write "bind <key> map" in-game.

-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCRIPTERS
--

(You don't need to do anything for normal blips, they already appear on the dxMap )

1. In the meta.xml of your resource, put:
<include resource="dxMap"/>

2. Use Export functions (client-side only!)

dxCreateBlip( int x = 0, int y = 0, int z = 0 [, int rotation = 0, int icon = 0, int width = 0, int height = 0, int color = tocolor(255,255,255,255), int visibleDistance = 16000] )
dxCreateBlipAttachedTo( element elemAttachedTo [, int icon = 0, int width = 0, int height = 0, int color = tocolor(255,255,255,255), int visibleDistance = 16000] )

Examples:
exports.dxMap:dxCreateBlip(0,0,0,0,6,32,32,tocolor(255,0,0,255) )
exports.dxMap:dxCreateBlipAttachedTo(localPlayer,2,16,16,tocolor(0,128,255,255), 100 )


-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODDING
--

Feel free to mod and release without permission

1. You can replace "map.jpg" with your own map
2. g_blipList table contains all of the icons. Add or modify this table with your own blip icons.
3. You can simply replace the files in the blips folder.

I tried to keep the syntax similar to createBlip() and createBlipAttachedTo(), but you have more functionality with dxMap so it the parameters had to change.

-- STUFF TO DO
--

This is a WIP so there is some missing functionality, PLEASE READ THE TODO!

TODO:
- make all blips black and white, so dx can tint them properly.
- add 'visibleTo' for dxBlips and normal Blips.
- make player icon (blip 0) show elevation level (up and down)
- add server-side functions (will just be triggerClientEvent based functions)
- hide the extraneous square outside the radar circle
