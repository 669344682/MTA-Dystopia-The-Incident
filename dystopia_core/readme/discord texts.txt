@everyone 

**Hello Forward Gaming!** 
I’m Zorgman, developer of Dystopia: The Incident, an original post-apocalyptic zombie sandbox action-RPG the likes of which you haven’t seen yet in MTA.

**What's this?**
This ain't just your standard MTA survival game, but a fully mapped world filled with interesting encounters. Food and water are scarce and you need to be on the move to stay alive. Inventory size is limited, forcing you to prioritize. Vehicles require constant maintenance. There are faction camps, bases, shanty towns and encounter zones scattered all over San Andreas. Exploration is rewarded. The world is densely populated and who you choose to kill matters. The environment is harsh and punishes the weak and the dumb. There are moral decisions to be made. There's an end goal and a sense of purpose. Roleplay friendly. Designed to also be enjoyable as a single-player experience.  

**What you can expect to find**
Explore a detailed post-apocalyptic map filled with encounter zones. Plenty of NPCs, both friendlies and baddies. Dynamic faction and spawn system. A detailed inventory with more than 100 items to be found and used. Basic needs, stamina, infection, various other modifiers like pain, bleeding, exhaustion or inebriation. Innovative looting mechanic. New vehicle damage/repair ‘system’. Three types of zombies, with different behavior. Scavenge the world for materials, use simple crafting and cooking. Escape the San Andreas mayhem by finding a suitable escape vehicle. Drive rugged vehicles across the wasteland. Discover glimpses of the story through setting and NPC chatter. Experience dark humor and some strong themes: I’d rate it 16+ to be on the safe side. Everything wrapped in a consistent interface and graphic style.
