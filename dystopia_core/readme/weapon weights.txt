**slot1**
knife = 0.5
sledgehammer = 3
chainsaw = 4
raider sword, bat, nitestick, crowbar = 2

**slot2** 
crossbow = 3
pistol, magnum = 2

**slot3** 
shotgun, spas = 3
sawn-off = 2

**slot4** 
MP5 = 3
Uzi = 2

**slot5** 
AK, M4 = 3

**slot6** 
rifle, sniper = 3

**slot7** 
 firethrower, rocket launchers = 4
 
**slot8** 
projectiles = 0.5 each
 
**slot9** 
 extinguisher = 2
 spray, binoculars = 0.5
 
**slot10**
 kitchen knife, meatcleaver = 0.5
 machete = 1

**slot11** 
googles = 0.5

**tools**
headlamp = 0.5
medikit = 0.5
toolbox = 1

Revising the list, I would remove weight from googles, headlamp and binoculars (unless I make them really useful, like highlighting targets for airstrikes or such); also, I would make weight of equiped toolbox 0.5 just like the medikit.
