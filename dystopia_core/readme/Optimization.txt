There's a plenty of events whose source is "root", this isn't a good practise.

Most of the ifs statements are using the following syntax:

	if x == true then
		if y then end
		if z then end
		if c then end

In most of the cases you don't have to check if the variable is a boolean, you can simply do
	if x then

You aren't using "or", that's going to save a lot of lines, will make the code more readable, and will run faster.
