Hi!  This resource aims to be a complete gamemode, starting as little other resources as possible. Some of the large scripts (like Manawydan's inventory, for instance) were modified and their inclusion was necessary, but some of the smaller ones were simply canibalized for convenience (damagesource is a good example). I tried to maintain a complete credits  list, but as development spanned over more than four years (up to this point) and it started as a personal server project, I might have omitted to add here some people whose work I used or could not identify the author. If you find yourself in this position, I apologize. Please write me an email at zoran_georgevici@yahoo.com and I'll update the credits.
