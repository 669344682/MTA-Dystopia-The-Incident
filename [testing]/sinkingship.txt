This resource has been uploaded by Ransom. I have changed authorship to Ratt:

This is an old MTAQA resource by Ratt, shown on the MTAQA Youtube in 2007. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMBUmDlUE5Y ... I have patched it for 1.0.4

Simply start the resource and you will spawn in the water. Type /sink in chat or sink in the console and the ship will start sinking.

This was mostly for demonstration purposes and it will not be updated. Feel free to modify it but give credit to Ratt.
