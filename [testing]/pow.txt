WARNING

This game mode is experimental. As part of this experiment I tried to play around with the possibilities of implementing custom fonts and such. Players may experience extensive loading times and FR drops on slow computers. Server admins are advised not to run this game mode on a public server.

Don't say I didn't warn you!

I also recommend not running the default scoreboard and killing messages resource. This game mode has its own. Running both resources at the same time may cause conflicts. Lastly keep in mind that most GUI coordinates are not relative! You will have to make it work yourself for resolutions other than 800x600 (my test mode).

Features:

- 32 slot team selection
- Role selection (engineer, grenadier, marksman and medic)
- Squad selection (alpha, bravo, charlie and delta)
- Campaign selection (assault and recon)
- Custom scoreboard
- Custom kill messages
- Projectile system (surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and barrage)
- Vehicle weapons (recon flares, barrage shells and bunker buster bombs)
- Vehicle damage system
- Vehicle fuel system
- Warfactory (unfinished)
- Object animation control (looped animation and lift triggers)
- World boundery control

Controls:

- LSHIFT for vehicle weapons (only after choosing a campaign at the warfactory)
- MOUSE1 (left mouse)/MOUSE2 (right mouse) for rotating vehicle turret (patriot in assault mode only)

Markers:

- Yellow marker: carrier lifts
- Spray can marker: vehicle repair
- Blue marker: vehicle fuel
- Purple marker: warfactory
- Orange marker/corona: vehicle ammo reload (only after choosing a campaign at the warfactory)

Known issues:

- Extensive loading time (should be fixed when MTA:DM starts shipping with descent font support)
- Objects created on the fly not showing correctly (this is due to MTA:DM bugs)
- Instruction text not disappearing
- Projectile desync (MTA bug)

Unfinished features:

- Match rounds (players are always able to join or respawn during the game)
- Team balance
- Warfactory (modshop) *
- Timers are not stopped **

* Important notice regarding the warfactory feature. The player is teleported to a fixed location in the default dimension! This means that you can not have multiple players in the warfactory at the same time. This was on the TODO list untill I stopped all development.
** When a player quits some timers remain active causing nil errors. This was also on the TODO list to fix.
