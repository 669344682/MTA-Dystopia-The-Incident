this is a quick script that allows you to drop bombs from airplanes. it works best with hydra or rustler. technically you can arm/drop a bomb from any vehicle, but that's because i'm a lazy coder.

type /airstrike to load/arm a bomb and type /airstrike again to drop the bomb. type "/bind r airstrike" and you can just press R twice to drop a bomb.

also, technically, it "unglues" any attached objects to the vehicle. so it will work strangely with glue scripts. (i think)



this is not supposed to be an "official release" or anything, i'm just trying to get a working version uploaded somewhere. the script can easily be improved by any other scripter (in a short amount of time, even)
